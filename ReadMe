First Step:
- make sure that I can open the pcap files and read a packet
- want to read a packet one by one and store it in a buffer that is as large as a packet
    - pcap_open_offline() - will open the file, save the file descriptor, and save any errors in error buffer
        - if cannot open the file (returned file descriptor is NULL), return error to STDERR
    - pcap_next_ex() - reads the next packet and returns success or failure
        - returns 0 if no packets to read
        - returns 1 if the packet gets read
        - -1 means there is an error
        - -2 means end of file is reached

Reading Ethernet Header:
- pcap_next_ex will return a pointer to the start of the packet payload
- first 14 bytes are guaranteed to be the Ethernet header
- The destination MAC address (6 bytes) then the source MAC address (6 bytes) then the type of the following data (2 bytes) 
- Store this info into a struct
- read out from the struct
- also keep global counter of how many packets there are total? 
- use the ethernet print functions to print it out right
